# Adapting LLMs for Text-to-SQL Generation in Low-Resource Languages: A Case Study of Chichewa

## Master's Thesis by John Emeka Eze (AIMS Rwanda, 2025)  

### Overview
This research addresses the gap in Text-to-SQL systems for low-resource languages (LRLs) by:
- Proposing a cross-lingual framework combining QLoRA fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and retrieval augmentated semantic parsing.
- Creating the small-scale Chichewa NL-SQL benchmark dataset
- Evaluating adaptation strategies for LRLs using Chichewa (spoken by 12M+ people)

### Note
- `data` folder contains a small-scale Chichewa benchmark. 
- `docs` folder contains the complete thesis and tables of results 
- `notebooks` folder contains codes of all the experiments carried out
